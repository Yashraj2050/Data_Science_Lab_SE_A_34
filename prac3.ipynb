        "*   **Matrix Initialization and Basic Operations:** NumPy was successfully used to create 2x2 matrices `A` (`[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`) and `B` (`[[5, 6], [7, 8]]`). Their sum was computed as `[[ 6, 8], [10, 12]]`, and their product (using `np.dot`) was `[[19, 22], [43, 50]]`.\n",
        "*   **Determinant Calculation:** For the 3x3 matrix `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`, the determinant was calculated to be `0.0` using `np.linalg.det()`.\n",
        "*   **Matrix Inverse and Verification:** The inverse of the 2x2 matrix `[[4, 7], [2, 6]]` was found to be `[[ 0.6, -0.7], [-0.2, 0.4]]` using `np.linalg.inv()`. Verification by multiplying the original matrix by its inverse yielded a result very close to an identity matrix, specifically `[[ 1.0e+00, -1.1e-16], [ 1.1e-16, 1.0e+00]]`, confirming the inverse calculation within floating-point precision.\n",
        "*   **Solving Linear Equations:** A system of linear equations represented by the coefficient matrix `A` (`[[2, 1, -1], [1, 3, 2], [3, -2, 1]]`) and the constant vector `b` (`[8, 1, 3]`) was solved using `np.linalg.solve()`. The solution vector `x` was determined to be `[ 2.4, 1.0, -2.2]`.\n",

        "*   The determinant of `0.0` for one of the matrices indicates that it is singular (not invertible), which is a crucial concept in linear algebra and suggests that a system of equations with such a coefficient matrix would either have no unique solution or infinitely many solutions.\n"
