        "BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue to keep track of the next nodes to visit.\n",
